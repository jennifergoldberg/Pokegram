### Project Zero - Pokegram
A Pokemon inspired photo share app
Our objective is to reverse engineer a similar web app to Instagram, called Pokégram. We, the developers, both regularly use Instagram and enjoy the user experience. Our version will be a Pokémon themed web app with features similar to Instagram. We decided to focus on 3 key features from Instagram:
- Create, edit and delete Posts 
- Like Posts
- Create, edit and delete comments on Posts 

We want to improve on the flow/design of Instagram by simplifying the post process and fitting each post to the visual height of the screen. Currently Instagram on desktop and occasionally on mobile require you to scroll to see the whole post including comments. We also want to make adding a post the most important feature, which we plan to extend to both phone, tablet, and desktop applications. 

### User Stories/ App Logic
The user will be presented with the index page showing all posts from all users. From here they will have an option to either create their own post, comment on posts, and click on specific posts to view. If the user choses to create a post, they will be redirected to the post create page where they will have to choose an avatar, input a username, link an image, and input text. Once posted the post will be available on the index page for everyone to see and for other users to like and comment. The user can also view comments on specific posts where it will redirect them to a show page showing that specific post with all comments associated with it. On this show page, the user can create comments, and also edit or delete comments associated with that post. The user will also have an option to delete or edit posts where it will redirect them to an edit page where they can change anything about the post. From here on, they user will have control to create, delete and edit both posts and comments, and like other posts and comments.
